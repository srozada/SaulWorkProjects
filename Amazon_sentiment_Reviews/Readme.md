Sentiment Analysis for the Management and Improvement of the quality of sales of food products offered by Amazon

This data science project aims to study the sentiments in the reviews of users who make food purchases through the platform. For the development, 
Google Colab is used in the free version, so that the impact of a very large dataset (568,000 rows and 10 columns) can also be analysed in an environment with limited resources. 
A business study is carried out to understand how to improve on what already exists, as well as to obtain an exhaustive knowledge of the platform's business model. Subsequently,
 an analysis and cleaning of the data is carried out, adjusting to the limitations of Colab's free environment. To do this, 15% of the data is taken from the dataset, 
and the necessary transformations are carried out in order to proceed to perform an NLP analysis.
The project results in a challenge that requires programming focused on saving resources, and the application of techniques to save RAM in the execution environment, 
such as dimensionality reduction, use of specific encoders, etc.
The results obtained using traditional algorithms for classification are very good in the case of composite algorithms such as Random Forest or XGBoost, 
as well as neural networks. Use is also made of the HuggingFace library, very useful in text processing applications, which allows the application of Transfer Learning, 
obtaining improved results with respect to those already obtained with algorithms trained from scratch.
